    abstract = "Argumentation is a type of discourse where speakers try to persuade their audience about the reasonableness of a claim by presenting supportive arguments. Most work in argument mining has focused on modeling arguments in monologues. We propose a computational model for argument mining in online persuasive discussion forums that brings together the micro-level (argument as product) and macro-level (argument as process) models of argumentation. Fundamentally, this approach relies on identifying relations between components of arguments in a discussion thread. Our approach for relation prediction uses contextual information in terms of fine-tuning a pre-trained language model and leveraging discourse relations based on Rhetorical Structure Theory. We additionally propose a candidate selection method to automatically predict what parts of one{'}s argument will be targeted by other participants in the discussion. Our models obtain significant improvements compared to recent state-of-the-art approaches using pointer networks and a pre-trained language model.",

    abstract = "The causal relationships between emotions and causes in text have recently received a lot of attention. Most of the existing works focus on the extraction of the causally related clauses from documents. However, none of these works has considered the possibility that the causal relationships among the extracted emotion and cause clauses may only be valid under a specific context, without which the extracted clauses may not be causally related. To address such an issue, we propose a new task of determining whether or not an input pair of emotion and cause has a valid causal relationship under different contexts, and construct a corresponding dataset via manual annotation and negative sampling based on an existing benchmark dataset. Furthermore, we propose a prediction aggregation module with low computational overhead to fine-tune the prediction results based on the characteristics of the input clauses. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and generality of our aggregation module.",

This dataset was created as there is a dire need for semantic search within archaeology, in order to allow archaeologists to find structured information in collections of Dutch excavation reports, currently totalling around 60,000 (658 million words) and growing rapidly. To guide this search task, NER is needed. We created rigorous annotation guidelines in an iterative process, then instructed five archaeology students to annotate a number of documents. The resulting dataset contains {\textasciitilde}31k annotations between six entity types (artefact, time period, place, context, species {\&} material). The inter-annotator agreement is 0.95, and when we used this data for machine learning, we observed an increase in F1 score from 0.51 to 0.70 in comparison to a machine learning model trained on a dataset created in prior work. This indicates that the data is of high quality, and can confidently be used to train NER classifiers.",

    abstract = "Previous research on empathetic dialogue systems has mostly focused on generating responses given certain emotions. However, being empathetic not only requires the ability of generating emotional responses, but more importantly, requires the understanding of user emotions and replying appropriately. In this paper, we propose a novel end-to-end approach for modeling empathy in dialogue systems: Mixture of Empathetic Listeners (MoEL). Our model first captures the user emotions and outputs an emotion distribution. Based on this, MoEL will softly combine the output states of the appropriate Listener(s), which are each optimized to react to certain emotions, and generate an empathetic response. Human evaluations on EMPATHETIC-DIALOGUES dataset confirm that MoEL outperforms multitask training baseline in terms of empathy, relevance, and fluency. Furthermore, the case study on generated responses of different Listeners shows high interpretability of our model.",

    abstract = "Emotion-cause pair extraction aims to extract all emotion clauses coupled with their cause clauses from a given document. Previous work employs two-step approaches, in which the first step extracts emotion clauses and cause clauses separately, and the second step trains a classifier to filter out negative pairs. However, such pipeline-style system for emotion-cause pair extraction is suboptimal because it suffers from error propagation and the two steps may not adapt to each other well. In this paper, we tackle emotion-cause pair extraction from a ranking perspective, i.e., ranking clause pair candidates in a document, and propose a one-step neural approach which emphasizes inter-clause modeling to perform end-to-end extraction. It models the interrelations between the clauses in a document to learn clause representations with graph attention, and enhances clause pair representations with kernel-based relative position embedding for effective ranking. Experimental results show that our approach significantly outperforms the current two-step systems, especially in the condition of extracting multiple pairs in one document.",

abstract = "Though much work in natural language generation remains to be done with regard to syntax, the main stumbling block that prevents existing generators from easily producing coherent paragraphs is our lack of understanding of text planning. To remedy this, we should view generations preeminently as a planning task; that is, we should study the goals that underlie text production, the plans that help achieve these goals, and the ways the plans can interact with grammar. A clue to the nature of these goals is the fact that people say the same thing in various ways. They can vary the content and form of their text when they want to convey more information than is contained in the literal meanings of their words. This information expresses the speaker's interpersonal goals toward the hearer and, in general, his perception of the pragmatic aspects of the conversation. This paper identifies goals that arise from pragmatic aspects of the conversation, plans and strategies to achieve them, and how they constrain the decisions a generator has to make during the realization process. To illustrate some of these ideas, a computer program is described which produces stylistically appropriate texts from a single representation under various settings that model pragmatic circumstances."

	Different context words have different influences on determining the sentiment
	polarity of a sentence towards the target. Therefore, it is desirable to
	integrate the connections between target word and context words when building a
	learning system. In this paper, we develop two target dependent long short-term
	memory (LSTM) models, where target information is automatically taken into
	account. We evaluate our methods on a benchmark dataset from Twitter. Empirical
	results show that modeling sentence representation with standard LSTM does not
	perform well. Incorporating target information into LSTM can significantly
	boost the classification accuracy. The target-dependent LSTM models achieve
	state-of-the-art performances without using syntactic parser or external
	sentiment lexicons.},

Present works in this domain do not explicitly consider the inter-personal influences that thrive in the emotional dynamics of dialogues. To this end, we propose Interactive COnversational memory Network (ICON), a multimodal emotion detection framework that extracts multimodal features from conversational videos and hierarchically models the self- and inter-speaker emotional influences into global memories. Such memories generate contextual summaries which aid in predicting the emotional orientation of utterance-videos.

	abstract = {Multi-view sequential learning is a fundamental problem in machine learning dealing with multi-view sequences. In a multi-view sequence, there exists two forms of interactions between different views: view-specific interactions and cross-view interactions. In this paper, we present a new neural architecture for multi-view sequential learning called the Memory Fusion Network (MFN) that explicitly accounts for both interactions in a neural architecture and continuously models them through time. The first component of the MFN is called the System of LSTMs, where view-specific interactions are learned in isolation through assigning an LSTM function to each view. The cross-view interactions are then identified using a special attention mechanism called the Delta-memory Attention Network (DMAN) and summarized through time with a Multi-view Gated Memory. Through extensive experimentation, MFN is compared to various proposed approaches for multi-view sequential learning on multiple publicly available benchmark datasets. MFN outperforms all the multi-view approaches. Furthermore, MFN outperforms all current state-of-the-art models, setting new state-of-the-art results for all three multi-view datasets. },
